                I am a graduate (MASc) Software Engineering student at Carleton University. My interest in software engineering started in 2016 when I took my first computer science class in Grade 11. The teacher gathered the class around his chalkboard and explained to us that we would be creating our very own webpage. 
                He showed us a few lines of code and told us to try it ourselves. I wonder how was &lthtml&gt or &ltp&gt going to create a webpage. To my surprise, within a few minutes, my bright white screen displayed the words "Hello World!" in small black text. I was amazed there was a whole new language to discover; a language that came naturally to me and was exciting to learn. I immediately knew that software engineering was a place where I could thrive.  I have 
                since had experience writing in: 
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>MySQL</li>
                    <li>UNIX command line</li>
            
                </ul>
                I have also gained experience working in groups using Github to host my projects. I have also built my own computer and I am particularly strong in Java and Javascript. 
                At the moment, I am incredibly interested in machine learning.

                My passion for Software Engineering is fueled by solving complex problems that seem impossible. I thoroughly enjoy coding the logic behind the function of the program. I have created this portfolio independently, coding everything from scratch in my free time.

                I am currently working full-time for my thesis supervisor at Carleton University. 
                We are researching how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning can be used for resource allocation in wireless systems such as 5G networks. 
                My most previous employment was for the Government at Statistics Canada. I spent ten months working in a database development team, preparing for the 2021 Census. I also spent eight months as a student researcher, looking for new software that could sync SDMX files between Canada and other countries. I love working out, playing golf, swimming, and skiing outside school.
