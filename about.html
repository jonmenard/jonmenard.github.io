                    Hello! I'm Jon Menard, a full-stack software developer with a strong foundation in both academic research and practical application.
                    I am currently working at Red Rabbit in Ottawa, where I specialize in creating tailored web solutions using Drupal and Laravel frameworks.
                    My role involves developing custom websites that include registration systems, e-commerce platforms, contest sites, and data analytics portals.
                    I am passionate about crafting seamless user experiences and delivering solutions that meet the unique needs of clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hold a Master of Applied Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering,
                    both from Carleton University. My academic journey allowed me to delve into complex topics,
                    such as multi-agent reinforcement learning for optimizing resource allocation in 5G networks.
                    Sponsored by Ericsson, my thesis work explored innovative approaches to resource management in mobile networks,
                    leveraging advanced neural network algorithms like QTRAN, MADDPG, and IQL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my tenure at Red Rabbit, I've honed my skills in managing the entire web development lifecycle.
                    I've successfully deployed multiple production websites using a comprehensive system that spans development, staging, and production environments.
                    Utilizing Docker Images, DDEV Environments, and orchestrating workflows through GitLab CI/CD,
                    I ensure efficient and reliable deployments with tools like Dokku and Docker Compose.
                    My technical expertise encompasses PHP, SQL, Python, Docker, OpenAPI, and Microsoft Azure OCR, among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before joining Red Rabbit, I worked at Statistics Canada, where I gained valuable experience in database management.
                    As a student intern, I supported the database application development team,
                    optimizing SQL queries and preparing data aggregation processes for the 2021 Census.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my professional work, I have a passion for machine learning and AI.
                    My personal projects include developing AI solutions for games and creating simulations using neural networks and genetic algorithms.
                    I enjoy exploring how these technologies can be applied to solve real-world problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I love staying active and engaged with the world around me.
                    I enjoy weightlifting, playing golf, swimming, and skiing. I am always eager to learn and grow, both personally and professionally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey in software engineering began in high school when I wrote my first "Hello World" webpage.
                    The excitement of discovering a new language and solving complex problems has driven me ever since.
                    I am thrilled to continue this journey, leveraging my skills and experiences to create impactful solutions and innovations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've developed and the technologies I enjoy working with.
